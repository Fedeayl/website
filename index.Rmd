I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.

Before joining WashU, I earned a Master’s degree (2024) and a B.A. in Political Science (2020) from the Universidad de la República (Uruguay).

My research focuses on political economy and distributive politics in Latin America, with a particular interest in how clientelism, party systems, and institutional reforms shape political behavior and representation. I also study affective polarization, especially in contexts characterized by weakly institutionalized party systems.

On this site, you can find my published work, replication materials, data, code, and other ongoing projects.
