I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.

Before joining WashU, I earned a Master’s degree (2024) and a B.A. in Political Science (2020) from the Universidad de la República (Uruguay), where I also completed a Diploma in Economics (2021).

My research focuses on two main areas. First, I am interested in political economy in Latin America, particularly issues related to distributive politics and political representation. Second, I study affective polarization and the factors that shape emotional and partisan divisions in politics.

On this site, you can find my published work, replication materials, data, code, and other ongoing projects.
