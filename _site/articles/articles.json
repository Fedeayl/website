    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nThe declaration of a public health emergency for COVID-19 forced the traditional March of Silence, one of the largest marches in Uruguay, to move completely online. In this unusual context, the article examines how public memories are developed through a quantitative analysis of Twitter activity that analyzed the struggle over memories of Uruguay’s recent past. As with the results of other research, thispaper demonstrates that there are at least two opposing public memories: the predominant one which has state terrorism as its central concept and is linked to the political left; and an alternative memory which follows the theory of the two demons. For each of the memories in this virtual battle, the article describes the associated actors and their social ties, including the participation of political parties, legislators, and state ministers.\nDownload HERE\n\nCite APA\nCite Bibtex\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nThe 1996 electoral reform made departmental elections independent from national elections in Uruguay and configured traditional first-past-the-post systems at the sub-national level. Yet, they preserved a voting mechanism called Double Simultaneous Vote that is crucial for the dynamic of the contest. This article proposes an adaptation of the classic theory of electoral coordination, considering the effects of that mechanism. Specifically, it argues that the upper limit of effective candidates in the system is four, which is twice the upper limit of a traditional majoritarian electoral system. This argument is tested using data for Uruguay during the 1971 to 2020 period.\nDownload HERE or read it in English HERE.\n\nCite APA\nCite Bibtex\n\n\n\n",
