## Abstract

he 2024 Uruguayan elections marked the return of the Broad Front to government after a period under the National Party and the Republican Coalition. This article analyzes the electoral process and outcomes within the framework of the consolidation of two stable political blocs: the Broad Front and the center-right coalition. Using data from the primaries, general elections, and plebiscites, it examines the evolution of competition between parties and blocs. The article highlights the stability of the party system alongside the growing significance of bloc competition. Finally, it discusses the challenges facing the new government and the prospects for the opposition.
